dframe Documentation
==================================

**dframe** is a Python implementation of indexless dataframes. dframe was
built to favor ease-of-use over computational speed. It's specifically aimed to
be easy and unambiguous for interactive use.

dframe provides `DataFrame` that is more similar to R's inbuilt dataframes
(without the ambiguity) than Python's pandas.
